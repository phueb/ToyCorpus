A simple Python class for working with sequences of artificial grammar.

## About

This repository contains two Python classes that instantiate two different artificial grammars. 
They are primarily for answering simple questions that come up during research in NLP and psycholinguistics,
such as:

1. How do the statistics of a corpus change when the vocabulary increases as more sequences are sampled?

A simple script is provided that plots an information-theoretic quantity I find useful in my work, 
and which I think has the potential to explain why it might be better to train NLP models on language data in a particular order.
